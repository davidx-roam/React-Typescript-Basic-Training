This repository contain a list of react typescript exercises. Fork the repository into your own account to try the exercises
To run the repository, do `npm run dev`. However, because these are mostly typescript exercises, most of the time you don't
need to see the UI, you just need to tweak the code until the typescript error disappears from your IDE.

- To do each exercise, create a new branch
- OPTIONAL - if you want to see the exercise, import it into `App.tsx` and do `npm run dev`
- Modify the exercise
- Open a PR for that exercise.
- Tag you onboarding buddy, or just another co-worker to review your changes and provide feedback.

> Note: You do not need to commit change for `App.tsx`
